_**This tool is a professional-grade Android malware analyzer designed to perform in-depth static analysis of APK files. Its key features include:**_

_**Dual Decompilation:**_

_**APKTool & JADX Integration: The tool attempts decompilation using both APKTool and JADX. It prefers the output from APKTool for initial analysis but always runs JADX to provide a complete view of the decompiled source.**_
_**Comprehensive Suspicious Pattern Detection:**_

_**Expanded Suspicious Patterns: It scans the decompiled code for a wide range of indicators including s> ensitive permissions, specific API calls, obfuscation techniques, networking and exfiltration signatures, persistence methods, suspicious filenames, privilege escalation, and malware behavior keywords.**_

_**Real-Time Flagging: Each match is flagged with a detailed message that indicates the nature of the suspicious behavior.**_
_**Intelligent Syntax Highlighting in Full Source View:**_

_**Customized Highlighter: The full source tab uses a custom syntax highlighter that colors keywords and patterns based on their category (for example, permissions might be highlighted in yellow, API calls in orange, obfuscation in magenta, etc.).**_

_**Interactive File Navigation: A navigable file tree lets users browse the entire decompiled source, and clicking on any file displays its content with highlighted suspicious patterns.**_
_**Flagged Results Dashboard:**_

_**Color-Coded Results Table: All detected suspicious indicators are listed in a table showing the file name, line number, indicator message, and a multi-line snippet of the code.**_
_**Detailed Code Context: Double-clicking any flagged result opens a detailed view that displays additional code context around the suspicious line.**_

_**Professional and Polished User Interface:**_
_**Advanced Dashboard: The tool features a refined dark-themed dashboard with a log area that provides professional progress messages.**_
_**Clear and Informative Feedback: Users receive detailed log messages throughout the decompilation and scanning processes, ensuring transparency and ease of use.**_
